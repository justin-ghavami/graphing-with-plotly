# graphing-with-plotly
When I first started out with my data analysis projects, I was not entirely sure which choice of graph was appropriate when exploring my data. The goal of this notebook is to help the user understand what chart to use and when to use it depending on the data that you have. Hope this can help you in your analytics journey!

You can copy and paste all this code and run it yourself. Most of it is taken from the Plotly documentation anyway, but I am happy to explain the differences and nuances between the graphs. I am a Tableau developer so it is important to understand the differences in my line of work.
